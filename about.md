Hey there! My name is <b>Jan David</b>.

I am a <b>software developer</b> living in <b>The Netherlands</b>.

Since trying out <b>Ruby</b>, I'm a huge fan of <b>software testing</b> and
<b>test driven development</b>. There will probably be a lot of posts on these
topics.

I am working for a Dutch startup called <b><a target="_blank" href="http://3dhubs.com">3D Hubs</a></b>.
You should totally check us out! We are at the frontier of the next industrial
revolution, bringing <b>3D printing</b> to the people.

My job requires me to catch up on <b>microservices</b> as fast as possible. This
comes at a great time for me, because I have played around with services a bit
over the past year. <b>But now it's time to get serious.</b>

If you want to learn even more about me, check out my <b>personal homepage</b>:
